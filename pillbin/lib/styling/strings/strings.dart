Conventional sewage treatment cannot fully remove these compounds, as it targets only general properties like pH and suspended solids. Even illicit drugs and their metabolites, contribute to water contamination in urban areas. The presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, groundwater, and drinking water globally leads to antimicrobial resistance, threats to species survival, reproductive issues, and increased cancer risks in humans.";
  static const Risk_1 = "The release of antibiotics into the environment, mainly through wastewater and improper disposal, drives the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Unused and expired antibiotics are often discarded in garbage, landfills, or sewers due to the cost of proper disposal. Even in small concentrations, these antibiotics promote resistance through horizontal gene transfer or genetic modification. This indiscriminate release transforms harmless microbes into resistant pathogens, compromising antibiotic effectiveness. When transmitted to humans, resistant bacteria lead to higher morbidity, mortality, and economic strain on healthcare systems.";
  static const Imapct_1 = "The rising presence of antibiotics for human and veterinary use in the environment and food chain has been linked to the obesity epidemic. The veterinary use of diclofenac, an NSAID, has critically endangered three Asian vulture species in the Indian subcontinent. Vultures feeding on livestock treated with diclofenac suffer organ failure (visceral gout) and die, disrupting ecosystems. Pharmaceutical contaminants also impact terrestrial and aquatic species, with psychiatric drugs like benzodiazepines causing behavioral changes in fish and their prey. These effects highlight the urgent need to regulate veterinary pharmaceuticals to protect biodiversity and prevent ecological harm.";
