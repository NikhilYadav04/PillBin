When I learned about environmental hazards from expired and/or unused medicines, I decided to investigate this issue. Hence, a survey was conducted to evaluate the community's knowledge with respect to drug disposal awareness. The survey showed that the majority of people have many unused or expired medicines at household level, and they are unaware of drug disposal methods as well as environmental hazards associated with them. The goal of this website is to educate the public on safe disposal practices, raise awareness about the environmental impact of improper drug disposal, and provide resources to prevent pharmaceutical pollution. By sharing knowledge and promoting responsible actions, we should aim to protect our environment and ensure a healthier future.",
